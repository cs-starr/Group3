Biocomputing II / cgi-biocomp2/bl
=================================

This directory contains the code for the business logic layer, including the modules that are designed to be used infrequently by the frontend (runAllcodon_use.py)
and the scripts designed for exclusive use by the business logic layer only. (calc_exons.py, codon_useage.py, prot_gene_alignment.py, rest_enzyme_activity.py)

Example code is present in bl_testing_api.py, to demonstrate the calculation functions and example output from the business layer.

It imports the `dbapi.py` module from the `../db` directory.
