The middle layer needs to:

1. Identify where the coding regions are in the genomic DNA (1st pass DONE)
2. Generate the coding DNA sequence from the DNA (1st pass DONE)

3. Align the protein sequence translation with the DNA coding sequence
4. Identify RE sites
5. Provide a list of available REs to the front end
6. Identify whether an RE has restriction sites within the coding region

7. Count codon usage in a gene (1st pass DONE)

8. Calculate codon usage across all coding regions (perhaps use the subroutine developed for
counting codon usage in a single gene) - store this somewhere; perhaps back in the
database or in a text file.

9. Extract information from the database layer such as the complete gene list or individual
gene information. (Some of these may simply be wrappers to database layer code) (1st pass DONE)
